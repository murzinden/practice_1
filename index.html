						Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the
						Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any
						subsequent orders placed by the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied.
						Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the Customer agrees that the
						Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by
						both parties.

						made by the Customer. In the event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether
						total or partial, the Customer must immediately provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of
						these changes. Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer of a change in ownership,
						the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds
						Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs, charges,
						fees and expenses incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company (including
						the same company but with a different shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a
						trust) which may have purchased the Customer's business or any interest in the Customer's
						business or any of the shares in the Customer and used the Customer's previously approved
						account for trading.

						Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct Debit,
						the Customer must provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in

						confirm new Credit Card information if applicable.

						subject to recognised trade tolerances.

					<p class="pageshopbodytext">

						the right to deliver Products in part deliveries. In the event that Shop incurs additional costs
						for meeting special (i.e. Tasmania / Northern Territory Deliveries) or urgent delivery
						arrangements, these additional costs may be charged to the Customer and may include the cost of
						airfreight where it is not the normal method of delivery. The Customer agrees to accept delivery
						of the Products sold at any time during normal business hours.
					</p>
					<p class="pageshopbodytext">
						Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any late delivery of the Products
						and late delivery will not entitle the Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's order for
						the Products.
